This is achieved through education, awareness, inspiration, and support.Young women and all those who menstruate are not always adequately informed about matters relating to their menstual and reproductive health, specifically the need for screenings such as cervical smears and information about menstrual conditions such as endometriosis.  There is a global need for improved menstrual health education, removing the taboo around discussing women’s reproductive functions, and improving access to period products.One of the main focus areas of Lady Talk Matters is providing education on menstrual and reproductive health to young pupilis in a fun an interactive way.  The syllabus is aligned with global curriculums and presented in a straightforward and factual manner.  The taboo around menstruation begins at this early age when boys and girls are separated during Life Orientation or sex education classes at school. It reinforces the impression that women’s reproductive health matters are shameful and secretive. By providing education to both boys and girls, this taboo can be removed to allow for open conversation.Together with this education, Lady Talk Matters works to ensure that basic period products are provided to women and girls in need.  They skill, train and employ ladies to manufacture re-usable period pads.

We want to bring awareness to the wider public of some of the issues that are common to the breed, that they need to be aware of before taking on a puppy or a rescue dog. There are so many puppies flooding the market now and people are sadly purchasing them without any research or knowledge of the breed.The coronavirus was somewhat of a challenge for us as for a period of time everyone wanted a dog during the lockdowns. Since the spring of 2021 we have seen a huge influx of Frenchies being surrendered to us. In recent times we have seen 8 dogs handed over to our rescue in one day! Rescue dogs are not the easiest but they can bring so much joy and love to you and your family. In rescue we’ve had the opportunity to meet many dogs, but meeting them sometimes at the lowest point of their lives. We’ve opened our hearts and homes to these dogs and we have to say we have been totally blown away by how they’ve changed and become very loving and trusting dogs.We hope you find our rescue as open, honest and trusting as we are. We look forward to working with you in the future in whatever capacity you are able to support us with.Many thanks form all at Frenchie & Friends Foundation, where we have built a rescue on foundations of the love for the breed.','https://www.justgiving.com/frenchieandfriends','https://images.justgiving.com/image/6b62b607-cf5a-419e-8c08-e569a7a392c4.jpg','Kent','DA16 1SP',0,NULL,'GB'),

It currently has good and well used facilities for our children over the age of 6 but only 2 swings for the little ones and nothing for those with physical challenges. This equipment was installed approximately 15 years ago and since then, apart from maintenance, no further funding has been spent on the playground due to the very limited and small budgets that are used quickly for other ongoing ground needs. As a parent of small children I have used the facilities on a regular basis but have always been very conscious of my small children using the climbing equipment as there are several open ended sections. So after consulting with other parents, grandparents and carers, I have pushed ahead with campaigning for new equipment to be installed for under 5''s so they can fully enjoy the park safely. Play ground equipment is very expensive, we raised money at the dog school, we have a little from Horsham DC and now I am calling on everyone who has an interest in supporting a local Parish initiative aimed at our younger residents to please help me raise the funds needed to make this happen.

Its purpose is to protect and enhance All Saints’ Church, a nearly 900-year-old church in Steep, a rural village in the heart of the South Downs National Park. This strikingly beautiful building dates from about 1125, with extensions and improvements from the period 1180-1200. Substantial restoration work was undertaken in the mid-1870s, when the wooden spire was added.  The interior contains some notable features, ranging from the 14th century font to the 20th century memorial ‘Whistler windows’, dedicated to the memory of Edward Thomas, the renowned poet who lived in Steep and who was killed in action at Arras in 1917. The church has also benefitted from outstanding local craftsmanship associated with Bedales School and the Edward Barnsley workshop. Strong as All Saints’ is in terms of history and beauty, it very much remains a ‘living’ community asset. The church enjoys wide local support at Easter and Christmas, when the congregation has on occasion exceeded 250 people, and acts as a welcoming backdrop for musical events, exhibitions and lectures. It is a popular setting for weddings, in addition to serving as a final - serene - resting place for loved ones. The Friends charity is established to engage with the entire community in seeking to ensure a strong and vibrant future for this historical treasure.','https://www.justgiving.com/friendsofsteepchurch','https://images.justgiving.com/image/68720def-21e4-4fa8-b7f5-6a285c74d4fe.jpg','Petersfield','GU32 2DF',0,NULL,'GB'),

The band maintains a busy contest and engagement schedule which includes regular bandstand performances at both regional and local venues, and seeks to work with its community in the Milton Keynes area by supporting organisations like Willen Hospice and the British Legion.​Originally known as Broseley Brass the band, was formed with just eight players in 1984 through the generous sponsorship of a building company called Broseley Homes Ltd. Broseley Homes Ltd was involved in the early development of Milton Keynes – the city in which the band is based. The sponsorship deal lapsed many years ago, but having developed its identity locally the band retained the “Broseley” name until 2009, when the band was re-named “Milton Keynes Brass”.​Under the leadership of the band’s first professional conductor Malcolm Holloway, and then subsequently and significantly under Paul Fensom, the band rose through band competitions from the Fourth to the Championship Section. MK Brass now (2019) competes in the First Section,  having been recently promoted from the Second Section under the band’s current M.D. Jonathan Mott, and is actively seeking promotion to the top flight again.','https://www.justgiving.com/miltonkeynesbrass','https://images.justgiving.com/image/','Nash','MK17 0EY',0,NULL,'GB'),

The grants can also be used for siblings of these children. Therapy may include more well-known professions such as Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech Therapy, but also those lesser known such as Music Therapy, Hippotherapy & Equine therapy, Hydrotherapy & Aquatic Therapy and counselling for example. The grants offered will be dependent on the amount of money Therapy Stars Foundation manages to raise, primarily through donations and fundraising. We would love to be able to support as many families as possible. Early Intervention is key for many young children with long term or life-limiting conditions and ongoing therapy is a way of life for most of these families. But the financial constraints placed on all families, as well as the reduced resources available through statutory services, have meant that many children do not receive the therapy that they need or deserve.','https://www.justgiving.com/therapystarsfoundation','https://images.justgiving.com/image/2d90480a-bc89-4002-b910-741280f99dfc.png','Penley','LL13 0LQ',0,NULL,'GB'),

The company is dedicated to demonstrating the rich cultural heritage of Africa’s theatre canon, and in so doing, dispel stereotypes and encourage authentic voices from the African Diaspora. Utopia Theatre believes that theatre is one way in which we can ‘catch the conscience’ of the people. Our mission is to stage creative works from Africa and its Diaspora through a process that actively engages African communities, facilitates the development of emerging artists and fosters dialogue and creative exchanges. With a unique style combining African theatre tradition with that of the Western world, Utopia Theatre creates artistic work which represents voices of the African diaspora in the 21st century. The company works in three main areas – theatre production and touring both in the UK and on the international stage, supporting new and developing artists, and using African Theatre and storytelling within the community.

The trust started with an aim to help disadvantaged children, and has since expanded their projects into Education, Mental Health, Empowering Women, Children Care, Agricultural Support and Covid Support to achieve this objective. The Trust’s main objective is to support underprivileged undergraduate students to continue and complete their education, as many students abandon their education due to their lack of funds for their upkeep.We at Blossom Trust strongly believe that female empowerment is the seed from which one can develop a nurturing, thriving community for the future generation.  Most of the disadvantaged families are headed by widowed women who are currently living in extreme poverty and malnutrition.  The Trust reviews each beneficiary’s requirement with their physical and mental abilities and provides carefully monitored, tailor made, support to improve their quality of life by allowing them to gain regular income and reduce their dependency on others.  By strengthening and sustaining their own household income, they will have an increased opportunity to lead a more independent family life.How we differ from others :  The running cost of our charity is borne by the trustees and, which helps us to ensure all the funds collected are used towards our projects.','https://www.justgiving.com/blossomtrust','https://images.justgiving.com/image/236cfd75-1ba5-475c-83ac-9083a1ae2be3.jpg','Ilford','IG6 1JG',0,NULL,'GB'),

To do this we have undertaken what we call St Marys Transformation Project. Our objective is that St Marys becomes a building to inspire our community through social interaction, environmental projects, and awareness of heritage. We want to host schools, clubs and societies and hold concerts, fayres, exhibitions, and festivals. There is so much we can do. We particularly want to encourage and support disadvantaged or vulnerable groups and central to our project are the principles of equality and inclusion.We are building access doors, access toilets, a café, removing pews and doing so very much more to make St Marys a welcoming place for everybody.Our vicar writes: “We want to open the doors of St. Mary’s Church building to share the space with the whole community”. Our vision is St Mary’s Church is a building that the whole community can use and enjoy while maintaining its core purpose of being a place for those who seek to worship Christ.Find out more about us on www.stmarysbillingshurst.org/transformation.

Its Round Church, in use by 1163, is probably the first Gothic building built in England. It recreated the shape and so the sanctity of the round Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, where Jesus and Mary Magdalene met on Easter Day. To be in the Round was to be ‘in’ the Easter Garden, at the centre of the world. In 1214-15, the Temple and its Church were the site of vital negotiations for Magna Carta. The Charter’s hero William Marshal was buried in the Round Church where his effigy still lies. The Church’s Chancel, consecrated in 1240 for the future burial of Henry III, is a masterpiece of Early English Gothic. In 1608, the Crown entrusted the Church’s care to the two Inns of Court, the Honourable Societies of Inner and Middle Temple [‘the Inns’]. The Inns have gladly discharged this duty ever since. The Church, at the heart of legal London, is still the cradle of the Common Law.The Temple Church is already the one building in the Temple where the community of the Inns meets the communities of London, of visitors, and of jurists from all over the world. The Inns are now equipping the Church, true to its origins in Jerusalem, to extend and deepen this role of intersection: as a place of genuine encounter for our atomized and conflicted world, under the aegis of the Inns and the Common Law, in mercy and truth, righteousness and peace.','https://www.justgiving.com/templechurch','https://images.justgiving.com/image/a6b120c8-db01-4450-84c0-9598fae6e80f.jpg','London','EC4Y 1AF',0,NULL,'GB'),

The damage was extensive and devastating: Classrooms and homes had their roofs blown off, irreparable water damage to the children’s books, furniture and personal belongings of the teachers. Through generous donations and other fundraising initiatives we have managed to build a new classroom block and restored teachers`accomodation. These dwellings are now fully functional.The Charity`s vision is not to stop at just restoring the buildings and resources, but to continually invest in the school to rebuild it as a pillar of a thriving community. We want to invest in futures for years to come.Our next goal is to raise at least £20.000 to go towards building an ICT suite and furnish it with basic IT facilities and solar power. IT is on the school curriculum, but there are currently no facilities at this school that the children can use. We hope that this site will be a beacon for other local schools who will also benefit from these facilities.All young people in the Rasa area deserve to live a better life. We are dedicated to providing opportunities for communities in the Rasa area.

In 1899 the pool was handed over to the Parish Council which continues to be responsible for it to the present day. In 1954 the pool was greatly modernised with filtration and a new surround. Unfortunately by the late eighties the Parish Council found the pool increasingly difficult to run and finance. It looked as if the pool would have to close. The village rallied round and raised a considerable sum of money and much hard work was done to replace aged equipment and clean everything up. A lease of the pool was negotiated with the Shere Parish Council. As a public pool must have a lifeguard in attendance this would have be an impossible financial burden so it was decided to operate as a private club. Shere Swimming Pool Club was formed. Between 2019 and 2022, thanks to receiving various grants and donations, the pool, plant room and changing rooms have been re-built to meet modern standards and now incorporate facilities to cater for the disabled. The Club is non-profit making and the lowest practicable subscription so as to remain accessible to all in keeping with Lady Russell''s intentions. There is currently a membership in excess of 800 (members and families). The members are welcome to bring guests for a nominal fee.

There is an urgent need to give all students the opportunity in the Summer term, not just to return to the classroom, but to have fun, to experience a trip somewhere, to feel the freedom of the seaside or a camping trip and to enrich their lives and undo the mental and emotional damage that lockdown will have caused.

In the last few years we have adapted this approach to work with people with Autism (ASD), people with learning difficulties, or complex issues including homelessness or addiction.We have developed the following areas of activities:Employment Support – we believe that everyone who wants to work can do so if they are offered the right support for them.  Our employment services offer support that meets the individual’s needs using both the traditional stepped approach and the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model.Employer support – this includes supporting employers to recruit staff and to support them to retain staff.Social Enterprises – we offer training within social enterprises for people who want to gain a new skill, increase their confidence and be part of a team.  This training can be part of a client’s recovery plan.  Clients accessing these services can also access employment support at the same time.Business and Enterprise support – providing one to one advice to clients who wish to start up or expand an enterprise.

Feedback from carers and social workers has been extremely positive as going through the bag makes the child more relaxed in their new environment.  We also run events throughout the year and have a Christmas party planned for this year and hopefully next Easter a day trip.

Following Rufus'' birth, we were able to spend 6 unforgettable days with our son thanks to having access to a Cuddle Cot. During this time we were able to do many of the ''firsts'' we had dreamt of with our boy including bath time, his first walk, meeting his grandparents and story. The memories we created are etched in our minds and have helped us immeasurably in our grief process.Our aim is to make sure every parent who faces the devastating reality of losing a child has access to this fantastic equipment which allows families to take time making memories with their precious baby(ies) in a private setting within the hospital, hospice or at even at home. Those extra hours and days can mean wider family members are also able to say goodbye.  Without a cuddle cot, a bereaved family will typically only have 10-12 hours with their little one before they are taken away.  Many studies have shown that increasing the amount of time parents have with their child(ren) will assist them with processing the mental and emotional difficulties of losing a child.  No amount of time will ever be enough, but allowing parents the flexibility and control of managing their final goodbyes in the way that feels best for them is something that all families deserve.','https://www.justgiving.com/rememberrufus','https://images.justgiving.com/image/7b52076f-e5d9-4129-a574-f6d4fd8717ca.jpg','Rugby','CV21 1AE',0,NULL,'GB'),

We believe patients, professionals and the public are united in the belief that this money is best used for the greater good - to help the many children’s charities across the country in their vital work.That’s why we make it possible for value driven dental practice to make a big difference - collecting and turning restorations and old donated jewellery, into cash - which becomes income for children’s charities.Why Gold For Kids?As dentists ourselves, we know that there is value in the restorations and precious metals we recover from patients. Traditionally, due to the relatively low value of a single restoration, that value was retained. But what if that value could be multiplied and used to benefit some of the most vulnerable children in the UK? This is why Gold For Kids was created.Where does the money go?Gold For Kids currently partners with Barnardos and NSPCC, with a view to expand our support to other childrens’ charities as our partnerships grow. Currently resourced entirely by volunteers, our registered charity status means that in the future, the costs of operating the charity will be covered by the gift aid recovered on donations, so the value of your donation is what is transferred to the charity.How can you help?By showing your support through a cash donation, old jewellery or discarded dental restorations.','https://www.justgiving.com/goldforkids','https://images.justgiving.com/image/ccbbe94b-e773-4aa7-a790-8c789b77a48b.jpg','London','W1G 8GE',0,NULL,'GB'),

The nurses provide a caring, empathetic and expert support to the child and will help guide them through all the confusions and emotions that news of a loved-ones death will inevitably bring. Each child is given the time and care they need to help begin to come to terms and an understanding of the impact that death brings to their lives.

However, Eduardo resisted the label of ‘pop artist’. His interdisciplinary work included creating sculptures in both bronze and aluminium, film making and working with prints. In 1959 he established a studio in Dovehouse Street, Chelsea. This served as his creative base whilst teaching in Hamburg ,Berkeley, Cologne, Munich and at the Royal College of Art in London. There are now many Paolozzi works held in public and private collections around the world. In London, he was commissioned to design mosaic murals for Tottenham Court Road underground station and he created the sculpted figure of (Isaac) ‘Newton after Blake’ for the new British Library in Euston Road. Before he fell ill in 1999, Eduardo had created a maquette for a sculpted head of the playwright Oscar Wilde. The Paolozzi Foundation has now commissioned the Pangolin Foundry to cast this sculpture in bronze. The intention is to site the sculpture in Chelsea, close to where Eduardo lived and worked. Both the Oscar Wilde Society and the Chelsea Society are enthusiastic supporters of this project. The Foundation is in advanced discussion with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea about the commission and the site. The intention is to unveil this sculpture in 2024, which is the centenary of Eduardo’s birth.','https://www.justgiving.com/paolozzifoundation','https://images.justgiving.com/image/','London','WC2H 7HF',0,NULL,'GB'),

Exercise is essential for healthy bodies and minds. Without it, well-being is damaged. Muscles deteriorate through lack of use. Thought processes become dull and disengaged. HOW? Our VOLUNTEERS aim to change inevitable outcomes – with fresh air, exercise stimulated by the horse, incentive to think ahead by being in charge for a change – all whilst having FUN.Many riders cannot be active any other way. Those with learning challenges may not see the need and lack the will to try. The HORSE stimulates: the RIDER responds. Rhythmic movement is calming for challenging conditions with consequential benefits for families and friends. We involve PARENTS, who relish respite from the stress of constant clinical appointments. They enjoy interaction with their child in a fun setting. Or if they prefer to sit and relax, we can offer that too. Opportunities for sharing experiences socially between parents is enormously beneficial for peace of mind. VOLUNTEERS are trained. They flourish in giving their support.

Thanks to the heroic efforts of medical staff and a nutritional dietary program Shelby survived this most fearsome of cancers and thrived. Indeed, today she is a 26 year old sophisticated young lady who just happens to be a talented artist.So grateful were Shelby’s parents for the treatment their daughter had received that they, together with a group of close friends, decided to start a charity that would help other sick children less fortunate.Since 1996 close to £950,000 has been raised and in 2016 the charity received a Pride of Britain award. Shelby contributes to this fundraising by offering her stunning works of art for auction at the annual Friends of Shelby Newstead ball.Shelby’s art has been selected for the National Students awards, displayed in the Mall Galleries, London, won the John Downton award and has exhibited in the Turner Contemporary.Shelby’s art continues to raise thousands of pounds for the charity founded in her name.Please help us to help others!','https://www.justgiving.com/friendsofshelbynewstead','https://images.justgiving.com/image/a062fda1-a95a-4434-96fb-ffbfc334e972.jpg','Culverstone Green','DA13 0TY',0,NULL,'GB'),

The church was completed in 1829. Since 1991 OSCA has carried out a series of major projects to keep the church wind- and water-tight.  The work has been required (by Diocesan authorities amongst others) to be carried out in keeping with the original design. OSCA has been involved in successfully raising funds through events and, in conjunction with St Andrew’s PCC, securing grants from a wide variety of local and national trusts.These include making the spire stonework safe (1993/94), re-slating the roof (1996), restoration of the nave windows (2001 – 2004), making the tower stonework safe and replacing pinnacles (2011/12).The current work of restoring the East window, vestry and lobby windows together with the clerestory windows will return the building to being both wind- and water-tight.Future projects include making the church and its facilities physically accessible in line with modern standards and expectations.','https://www.justgiving.com/ombersley-sca','https://images.justgiving.com/image/','Ombersley','WR9 0EP',0,NULL,'GB'),

In earlier times before modern navigational aids, a riding light was lit on top of the tower to guide sailors on stormy nights, and even today there are strong links with the Thames Estuary and south coast ports. We are currently undertaking an ambitious programme to make the church more user-friendly, but recent repairs to the church tower have revealed terrible decay in the centuries old oak timber beam. We tried first of all to patch it and save some of the very old parts but now we discover we have no option but to renew the beam by installing and laminating together six new timber boards. Added cost of timber, labour & time delays mean we have to find £70,000 more than we had budgeted for – we are desperately trying to raise this amount by appealing to all our supporters and funders. We are eager to press on with our project to develop a Heritage Activity Programme that features arts & crafts, History & heritage and the natural environment and will make the most of our maritime connections with the sea, Cinq Ports and Tudor England. Local fund-raising is ongoing  but we need to encourage generous donations from one and all to save our iconic landmark.','https://www.justgiving.com/friendsofallsaintsbrightlingsea','https://images.justgiving.com/image/93388f0c-8516-46c0-8629-1b686ee248cb.jpg','COLCHESTER','C07 0JD',0,NULL,'GB'),

Our mission is to engage men and boys in a way that enables them to rethink some of the social norms they have been taught about themselves so that they can aim towards a society that practises true gender equality, encourages respectful and positive relationships and prevents gender-based violence. Our workshops are led by trained facilitators who are able to lead and guide conversations on many of subjects that people find it difficult to discuss: sex and relationships, mental health, consent, violence, language and personal agency.  Consistently, participants report that this is the first time many of them have realised the impact of their behaviour in their community, opened up about their own difficulties, learnt about those of their peers, and discovered ways to help be part of solving the problems.

Symptoms include laughing seizures leading to severe cognitive and behavioural problems similar to autism (and so HH is sometimes misdiagnosed as autism).  Our small charity is entirely volunteer run - the trustees comprise HH sufferers and parents determined to increase awareness of, and therefore accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of, this complex syndrome, which is often missed by paediatricians and radiologists.   Our personal outcomes have been varied, but each of us remains committed to improving detection rates and finding a cure.  Every penny raised is spent on research or patient support. The next generation is already benefitting, with children starting to achieve some exceptional outcomes through new technologies supported by us.  Our most important achievement is to have facilitated communication between brilliant but disparate experts from all corners of the world; they are now working together - including as part of our Medical Advisory Board - better to understand and treat this devastating syndrome.  Laser Ablation Surgery, facilitated by Hope for HH, recently commenced in Great Ormond Street Hospital, bringing more hope to UK sufferers of this and other focal epilepsies.

Ofsted rated the Playschool “outstanding” in personal development and “good” overall during the last inspection.  Many nurseries have closed within the local area for various reasons including lack of funding and there are a limited number of spaces in nurseries for children in funded places. As a result, Alton Community Playschool’s childcare service is vital within the community.  We are fundraising to keep the nursery open so that every child within the local community benefits from high-quality education.  The money raised will be used to support the following these key projects: •        our core service of daily provision of high-quality tailored childcare; •        develop the garden to reflect the seven areas of children’s learning; •        purchase specialised equipment to support children;  •        become a Family Hub to support a greater number of disadvantaged families within the community; and  We would also appreciate donations of personal care items for the children, such as nappies, baby wipes and clothes.','https://www.justgiving.com/altonplayschool','https://images.justgiving.com/image/d8470e47-cd66-478d-8c32-fef3837ee145.jpg','LONDON','SW15 4LY',0,NULL,'GB'),

The two flagship choirs, Southend Boys’ and Girls’ Choirs, have been in existence for over 80 years with thousands of children and young people having performed in the Choirs. Many former choir members have developed successful careers within the music industry. The range of performance opportunities is extensive, with the choirs providing backing vocals and flash mobs to full scale professional concerts. The opportunity to take part in overseas tours is offered on an annual basis. Singing in a group has numerous benefits, including mental and physical health, self-confidence, learning and social development. It is one of the most engaging forms of self-expression which allows individuals to explore emotions, build self-esteem and develop relationships. From the youngest groups (Little Singers and Step Up) to the oldest (Young Men’s Chorus and Chorus Sirenum), there is a clear transitional pathway for young people to develop their vocal skills, and interest in music, outside of the school environment.

For this reason, when the orchestra had their debut in the autumn of 2016 - performing Beethoven''s Ninth Symphony with the Hastings Philharmonic Choir - they chose the White Rock Theatre as their opening venue.The 1930s-60s was a dynamic period for classical music in the south-east, and Hastings was pivotal to this dynamism. Many great names of the classical music world came to Hastings: renowned conductors Sir Henry Wood, Sir Adrian Boult, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir John Barbirolli; and many brilliant soloists, including Sergei Rachmaninov (in 1935 and 1936), Vladimir Horowitz and Arthur Rubinstein, and the Spanish cellist Pablo Casals. These were the golden years of classical music in Hastings, when our town was at the heart of a vibrant classical music scene.In founding a new professional orchestra in Hastings, the artistic director and principal conductor of Hastings Philharmonic Orchestra, Marcio da Silva, set himself the challenge of putting Hastings back on the map as a centre of excellence for classical music - one that will be recognised both nationally and internationally. The orchestra has recently been described as ‘the jewel of Hastings cultural life.''','https://www.justgiving.com/hastingsphilorchestra','https://images.justgiving.com/image/c2ae0778-b7aa-4161-a8ba-bfe825b60c93.jpg','St Leonards on Sea','TN37 6AU',0,NULL,'GB'),

With the passage of time, MLPMA felt the need to make specific provision for Local Preachers and their dependants in terms of residential care in retirement. This led to the formation of Mutual Aid Homes (MAH) in 1949. Both MLPMA and MAH were charities with specific focus on the Methodist Church, In 2004 MLPMAA became the Leaders of Worship and Preachers Trust (LWPT) and Mutual Aid Homes became the Leaders of Worship and Preachers Homes. The Christian mission for LWPH essentially replicated that of MAH whilst that of LWPT was directed to broader ecumenical horizons. Both are charities and companies limited by guarantee.LWPHomes aim is to provide the best care and accommodation for those looking for active Christian residential care in retirement by offering:- an excellent quality of life;- at a price that represents good value for the high quality of care and accommodation provided;- in an atmosphere of Christian family values with daily prayers and regular celebrations of Holy Communion.LWPHomes also has 10 flats at Gainsborough House in Milborne Port, Dorset.

It''s a chance for them to get to know us and for us to deal with any immediate needs they have such as medical treatment, food, water and to provide counselling. Our aim is to encourage children to leave the streets behind, but without forcing them; it has to be their choice.  When a child decides they want to leave the streets, they stay at our Interim Care Centre (ICC) whilst our Social Workers track down their family and ensure it is a safe environment for the child to return to. We provide counselling to the family and child, in the hope that the original issues that led to them turning to the streets are resolved.  Once the child has returned to their family, we continue to check-in on them and pay for their schooling or vocational training. We also offer other support such as medical treatment, home essentials, support to start a business, whatever is needed to keep the child at home and off the streets.','https://www.justgiving.com/laughterafrica','https://images.justgiving.com/image/1d15c603-a995-4275-9284-4fc633583d89.jpg','Wirral','CH63 5LP',0,NULL,'GB'),

We also want children to have the experience and pleasure of taking part in musical activities and ensembles, especially as so many schools do not offer music as part of their curriculum. Access to learning an instrument should not be elitist! The money we raise goes towards: bursaries for those that want to learn an instrument but find the fees a barrier; buying new musical instruments for the pupils to play; hiring concert venues in which the pupils can perform (RNCM, Stoller Hall, Peel Hall); buying new sheet music for all of the playing groups and bands, and supporting summer musical tours that are organised approximately once every two years, pandemics allowing, for the senior orchestra and concert band.The Friends are all parents of children who are currently with or have been with the music service.

The Green is managed for wildlife and the community and since its creation, paths have been laid, pedestrian access created, seats installed, a Tool Store built, a community orchard planted and wildflower areas developed.The Green is important for wildlife being neutral grassland overlaying Magnesian limestone making it valuable for biodiversity.  A survey found 13 different varieties of grass, creating feeding & breeding opportunities for a variety of invertebrates that form the base of the natural food chain.  The Green is also an important resource for local people as it provides peace& tranquillity and an opportunity to see nature first hand virtually on their doorstep.  Being able to spend time in a green space is of proven benefit for people’s mental health & general wellbeing.  Also, as the Green lies on a slope it offers great sledging opportunities, snow permitting.The Green is cared for by a small team of dedicated people who give up their time to look after & develop the Green.

We are Scotland’s specialist agency for the placement of sibling groups, children with disabilities and those severely affected by the trauma of neglect and abuse. Our aim is the successful outcome of adoption through well-developed adoption support. Instead of traditional parenting techniques, adopted children require a style of parenting which is more sensitive to their emotional needs.  Adopted children’s early experiences mean they can often struggle with relationships and day-to-day life. Their early needs have often gone unmet, and all have experienced some form of loss or trauma.  Many have suffered abuse or neglect; all have been separated from their birth families and have spent time in the care system. This leads to a small percentage of adoptions disrupting because of those unresolved relationship difficulties between the adopted child and their adopters who frequently develop a sense of feeling overwhelmed by their child''s distressed behaviours.','https://www.justgiving.com/standrews-children','https://images.justgiving.com/image/b3e9769a-76d8-4c80-8a1b-91e8feacf77d.jpg','Edinburgh','EH6 7EL',0,NULL,'GB'),

Originally set up to rehome abandoned and unwanted animals within the Ryedale area it soon became apparent that there were a large number of dogs in the East Riding of Yorkshire area and beyond facing the threat of unnecessary destruction and desperately needing our help.From humble beginnings homing 12 dogs in the first year we now home approximately 80 dogs per year and in 2018 homed our 1000th dog since we began.Ryedale Dog Rescue is run entirely by volunteers who take no personal expenses from the charity. We raise all our own funds through Fun Dog Shows, Tombola’s, Car Boot Sales, Raffles, Bingo nights, Coffee Mornings, and many other events. All the proceeds go directly to saving the lives of abandoned and unwanted dogs and finding them new forever homes.Welfare is of top priority to us and we pride ourselves on giving the dogs top quality veterinary care while they await their new homes in high quality kennels.Following our Annual General Meeting in April 2012 we unanimously agreed to adopt a non destruction policy meaning no dog taken into our care would never be destroyed (other than on veterinary advice due to illness) and that we would implement a total neutering policy so all RDR dogs are either neutered while in our care or within six months of moving to their new homes dependant on age.','https://www.justgiving.com/ryedaledogrescue','https://images.justgiving.com/image/34246e49-946b-41fe-b65e-3c293baaa3b3.jpg','Malton','YO17 9EG',0,NULL,'GB'),

We use ingredients that are unfit for sale, at 0 cost! We collect old butter or yoghurt tubs to pack leftovers at the end of a FEAST!

The Sheffield Family Holiday Fund enables local families to enjoy a break away from everyday life and to take a much needed holiday.The families supported by the charity are those who truly struggle with the challenges life can bring. Many are dealing with issues of severe or sudden illness in the family, bereavement, disability and mental health issues. Recent research shows that holidays widen people’s perspective on life. A holiday experience for a child often results in better attendance at school and ultimately helping them to perform better and feel happier. Families are directly referred by professionals in the local community who are best placed to identify those who will benefit the most. We partner with national charity the Family Holiday Association to arrange the trips which range from a local cultural day trip to a family break in a caravan at the British seaside.There are over 40,000 children in Sheffield living in poverty and at the moment we are only able to help 2% with a much needed break. Your donation will go directly to Sheffield families and we hope that as you plan your next holiday, you may consider helping other families create those life long memories.','https://www.justgiving.com/sheffield-family-holiday-fund','https://images.justgiving.com/image/71092918-3b3c-4c9a-bf85-73088a6a002e.jpg','Sheffield','S10 3TQ',0,NULL,'GB'),

The Pool offers the known benefits of hydrotherapy in a supportive environment that builds confidence and allows privacy. Benefits include improved mobility, easing of pain and growth in confidence.The pool supports people recovering from long term conditions, physical and mental health conditions and operations. It is not always possible for long term sufferers to return to work, but where hydrotherapy is offered it can speed up recover after surgery for instance. With chronic long-term mobility problems, users report that they can maintain better levels of independence from regular sessions. The confidence and wellbeing of receiving social group therapy with other people in the same situation, in the privacy of a dedicated hydrotherapy pool cannot be underestimated.Our fundraising enables this therapy to be delivered at an affordable cost (so as not to exclude the vulnerable users), to provide personalised and specialist sessions and to maintain the pool environment to a high standard.','https://www.justgiving.com/southlakelandhydrotherapy','https://images.justgiving.com/image/d883b8f2-a14e-4076-bc4a-9fe4fc79f971.jpg','Staveley','LA8 9PJ',0,NULL,'GB'),
